# VSD_SoC-PD_using_open_source_EDA_tools
This repository is to give brief idea about the VSD's 'Beginner Soc/Physical Design using open source EDA tools' Workshop. The workshop gives me a hands on experience with the EDA tools used in Physical Design.

*Here are some sources used in this workshop:

1.YOSYS : Synthesis.
2.Graywolf :Placement.
3.Qrouter : Routing.
4.Qflow : RTL2GDS integration.
5.Netgen : LVS.
6.OpenSTA & Opentimer : Prelayout & postlayout Static Timing Analysis.
