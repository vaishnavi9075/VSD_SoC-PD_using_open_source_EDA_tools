# VSD_SoC-PD_using_open_source_EDA_tools
This repository is to give brief idea about the VSD's 'Beginner Soc/Physical Design using open source EDA tools' Workshop. The workshop gives me a hands on experience with the EDA tools used in Physical Design.

*Here are some sources used in this workshop:

1.YOSYS : Synthesis.

2.Graywolf :Placement.

3.Qrouter : Routing.

4.Qflow : RTL2GDS integration.

5.MAGIC : VLSI Layout tool.

6.Netgen : LVS.

7.OpenSTA & Opentimer : Prelayout & postlayout Static Timing Analysis.
